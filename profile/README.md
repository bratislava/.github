## 🏛️ Bratislava Github

> **Coming from a recent workshop or a talk ?** Browse around or [look below](#coming-from-a-workshop-or-a-talk)

The official Github repository of the city of [Bratislava](https://bratislava.sk).

We're making many of our projects open-source, as we believe this promotes [savings, collaboration, auditability and innovation](https://publiccode.eu) in the public sector.

Our goal is to be transparent about services we're developing and providing, as well as to invite other cities and municipalities to build on top of the same or similar open-source technologies we've already tested and used - to foster an ecosystem of collaboration between teams facing similar challenges. We'll be happy to [get in touch.](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

Maintained by the Bratislava Innovation Team. Meet us at the yearly [Climathon](https://climathon.bratislava.sk/) 🐯 !
